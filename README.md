# AI Mood DJ

**AI Mood DJ** is an interactive web application that uses artificial intelligence to detect your facial emotion from a webcam snapshot and then generates and plays music that matches your mood. The app provides a seamless experience: simply start your camera, capture your image, and let the AI do the rest!
